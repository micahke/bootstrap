To make the FileWalker faster, you could consider using multithreading or multiprocessing to parallelize the file walking process. Here's a simple example of how you could modify the `walk` method to use multithreading:

```python
import os
import re
import threading
from typing import List
from data.config import Config
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

class FileWalker:
    def __init__(self, config: Config, dir: str) -> None:
        self.config = config
        self.dir = dir
        self.filepaths = []

    def process_directory(self, dirpath, dirnames, filenames):
        base_dirname = os.path.basename(dirpath)
        if base_dirname in self.config.excluded_dirs:
            dirnames[:] = []
            return
        for filename in filenames:
            if any(filename.endswith(ext) for ext in self.config.filetypes):
                self.filepaths.append(os.path.join(dirpath, filename))

    def walk(self) -> List[str]:
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
            for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(self.dir):
                executor.submit(self.process_directory, dirpath, dirnames, filenames)
        return self.filepaths
```

In this code, we're using a ThreadPoolExecutor to create a pool of worker threads. For each directory in the directory tree, we submit a new task to the thread pool to process that directory. This allows multiple directories to be processed in parallel, which can significantly speed up the file walking process if there are many directories and/or files. Please note that the optimal number of worker threads depends on the specific circumstances and might need to be adjusted.
